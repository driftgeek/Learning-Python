# Learning-Python with Computational Math

I am currently taking a Math course that require the use of Python. The way I see it is by creating functions within Python,  they can be reusable for future programs. I believe that keeping a record of my codes will enable me to find a better way to execute them and use debugging practice. From time to time, I will include adjustments when necessary.

Easy part:  I am familiar with the numerous mathematical theorems and methods. 
Hard part: Transferring my knowledge into Python. This challenge involves me having to reference the basics of Python.

*Here are some of my Python Programs that I have so far:*

2. Finding the Average, Highest, and Lowest grades
  * Basic uses of the various mathematical functions in Python to find the avg, min, and max of items 

3. The Prime Number Function

4. Verifying the Prime Number Theorem 

5. Finding the GCD
