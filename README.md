# Learning-Python with Computational Math

I am currently taking a Math course that require the use of Python. Easy part:  I am familiar with the numerous mathematical theorems and methods. Hard part: Transferring my knowledge into Python. Here are some of my Python Programs that I have so far:

[create an anchor](#finding-the-average,-lowest,-and-highest-grade)

[create an anchor](#prime-number-function)

[create an anchor](#verifying-the-prime-number-theorem)

[create an anchor](#finding-the-gcde)
